<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Brandon van Wyk and I reside in Windhoek, Namibia. I am a 33 year old husband and
  father of two. I have decided to continue pursuing a career in Web Development at this age,
  which I feel is quite old for the tech world, because I am a creator. 
  I love how elements come together to create something new and I love more to be part of that process.
  I always felt I am an analytical thinker and I always knew that I have so much potential
  and skills to give to the world. 
</p>

<p>I am a husband and father and I am at the point where I need to think about my children.
  I want to be in a position where I can provide for them and be a role model they are proud of.
  To do this I need to achieve my dreams and show them it can be done.
